🐄 404 Not Found – Livestock Access Platform
📖 About

If you come from a traditional South African family, you’ve probably experienced a ceremony or event where livestock was needed — be it for weddings, funerals, or cultural rituals. Finding and securing the right livestock, at the right price and location, can be a stressful and time-consuming process.
404 Not Found is a group-driven initiative aimed at solving this challenge. We've identified the opportunity to create a platform that simplifies the livestock sourcing experience while bringing value to both buyers and sellers in rural and urban communities.
